I am a DBA and a developer, dealing with Oracle products for about 10 years.
My areas of interest are Databases and Software development.

This little project was created in order to quickly share scripts,
tutorials and thoughts I happen to have documented among other things.

One of the main goals is to have an easy access to them,
without having to read too much how to use them.
The main subject gravitates around, but is not limited to
the Oracle Database and/or [Oracle Corporation](https://www..oracle.com)'s products.

The things posted here will be either developed by me or taken from resources such as the Oracle Documentation.
